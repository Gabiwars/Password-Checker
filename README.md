# Password-Checker

Do you want to check if your password have been leaked before by someone else? 
Try using this program and it will tell you how many times your password have been leaked before.
Knowing if your password has been used before can prevent a dictionary attack by a hacker.
A dictionary attack is when a hacker use like a huge Excel database with usernames and passwords in different websites to try to login.
Don't worry you won't be sending your actual password to the website I am using in this program. Your password will be hashed! Using the module hashlib.
